# How to contribute

Our project is opened for contributions, and we are always happy to welcome best pieces of code from the Github community. So, **here are some ways you can help us**:

- [Feature requests](#feature)
- [Bug reports](#bug)
- [Pull requests](#pull)
- [More information](#info)

## <a name="feature">Time for new features</a> 

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [Github Repository](https://github.com/salman-bhai).

## <a name="bug">Bug reports</a> 

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search**. Check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**. Try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.

3. **Provide environment details**. Provide your operating system and browser(s).

4. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case**. Create a reduced test case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

* What is your environment?
* What steps will reproduce the issue?
* What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
* What would you expect to be the outcome?
**All these details** will help people to fix any potential bugs.

### Example:

>Short and descriptive example bug report title
>A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

>This is the first step

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
